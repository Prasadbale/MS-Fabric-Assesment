# Fabrikam Manufacturing – Microsoft Fabric Analytics Solution

## 📌 Business Context
Fabrikam Manufacturing, a multinational consumer electronics manufacturer, is facing **operational inefficiencies** and **data management challenges** due to:
- Rapid global expansion
- Increased production volumes
- Rising market competition

The current **disparate data environment** limits timely analytics, impacting:
- Supply chain efficiency
- Predictive maintenance capabilities
- Customer satisfaction

---

## ⚠ Core Challenges

### 1. Complex Manufacturing Data Landscape
- Multiple fragmented systems: **ERP**, **MES**, **IoT sensor networks**, maintenance records, supplier databases, CRM, and external market data.
- Data variety: **Structured** (SQL databases), **Semi-structured** (JSON, XML logs), and **Unstructured** (sensor logs, text maintenance records).

### 2. Real-time Operational Visibility
- No real-time view of production, equipment health, or inventory levels.
- Delays in anomaly detection → increased downtime and losses.

### 3. Supply Chain Optimization
- Difficulty managing supplier data, tracking deliveries, predicting demand.
- Limited predictive analytics → inefficiencies and stock shortages.

### 4. Customer & Market Analytics
- Poor analysis of market trends and customer preferences.
- Limited personalization and proactive engagement.
